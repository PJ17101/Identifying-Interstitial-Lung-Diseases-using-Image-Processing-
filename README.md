# Identifying-Interstitial-Lung-Diseases-using-Image-Processing-
To design a system that retrieves similar images using the image features such as the Gabor Wavelet and Discrete Wavelet transform. The system is basically built for identifying lung diseases using the CT scans of the lungs, the existing CT scan images of the diseases are taken into the database and the feature extraction process is done upon them the values are stored in a matrix and then in the end these values of database images are compared with the query image and by using the similarity metric (manhattan distance), the most relative image is retrieved.
